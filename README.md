## Sprint Plan
Our forecast for this week (Mar 15 - Mar 22) is to complete user story(ies):
- Expanded Day View of Classes
- View Schedule of Classes
This was in our sprint last week and we did not realize how many child tasks were involved 
in this. Melissa, Jared, and Chinwe particpated in this activity.

## Daily Scrum - 03 / 15 / 2021
What We did:
- Jared: setting up Node/Express/Prisma Enviroment
- Chinwe: Onclick event for Day component
- Melissa: Setting up dockerfile and host site live

What We Will Work On:
- Jared: Make a Lecture table for modified lectures;
- Chinwe: Make onclick look legit 
- Melissa: Adding endpoints to get student, professor, & course info as needed for frontend

Blockers:
- Chinwe: smart way to use CSS trnasitions to animate width rather than getting npm library
- Melissa & Jared: merge conflicts, secrets preventing from auto-deploy
