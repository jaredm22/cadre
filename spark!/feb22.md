### Product Backlog
Link to Product Backlong is [here:](https://buspark.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CAD/boards/15/backlog)
</br>
The reasoning of how we ordered our product backlog was that we ordered the items that we thought were vital to the app on the top and those after those are items that the app could feature, but it is not entirely necessary to it.

#### Forecast
- 02/22/2020 - 02/29/2020: We forecast to work on the **Switch calendar view b/w 1 and 5 days** story and **View Classes on Calender** story.
  - Our rational behind our forecast is because these two tasks are on the top of our backlong list and thus since these are the most important tasks on our backlog, it makes up the core of our app, so we need to get these task done first in order to make our app functional and thus easier to implement other non-necessary features.
